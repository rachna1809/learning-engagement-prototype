    Personalization in learning embodies this principle, turning passive recipients into active participants by tailoring content to individual needs, preferences, and learning styles. 
    AI-powered personalization takes this further, leveraging data to analyze learner behavior, predict challenges, and deliver dynamic, adaptive content in real-time. 
    This not only enhances engagement but also boosts retention and motivation by making learning feel relevant and intuitive. For organizations, integrating AI into education ensures scalable personalization, fostering meaningful connections between learners and content, ultimately driving better outcomes.
